								<h2>HTML Interview Question & Answers</h2>
								<button class="accordion">What is HTML?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a language of World Wide Web. It is a standard text formatting language which is used to create and display pages on the Web. It makes the text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links. More details.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are some common lists that are used when designing a page?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>There are many common lists which are used to design a page. You can choose any or a combination of the following list types:
  <br>
<b>Ordered list</b> - The ordered list displays elements in numbered format. It is represented by < ol> tag.
<br>
<b>Unordered list</b> - The unordered list displays elements in bulleted format. It is represented by < ul> tag.
<br>
<b>Definition list</b> - The definition list displays elements in definition form like in dictionary. The < dl>, < dt> and < dd> tags are used to define description list.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the difference between progress and meter tag?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The progress tag is used to represent the progress of the task only while the meter tag is used to measure data within a given range.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between HTML elements and tags?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>HTML elements communicate to the browser how to render text. When surrounded by angular brackets <> they form HTML
tags, which come in pairs and surround text.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What does DOCTYPE mean?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The term DOCTYPE means Document Type Definition and tells the browser which type of HTML is used on a webpage. Browsers
use DOCTYPE to determine how to render a page. Failing to use DOCTYPE will load your page in Quirks Mode</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What are the limitations when serving XHTML pages?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The main limitation is the poor browser support of XHTML. Internet Explorer and other user agents cannot parse XHTML as
XML. Thus, it is not that extensible language as one might think.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the syntax difference between a bulleted list and numbered list?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Bulleted lists use the <ul> tag, which stands for “unordered,” whereas <ol> is used to create an ordered list.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are some common lists that are used when designing a page?</button>

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between progress and meter tag?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The progress tag is used to represent the progress of the task only while the meter tag is used to measure data within a given range.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between the application model of HTML and HTML5?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>There is not a big difference between the two. HTML5 is a continuum of HTML. There has been no major paradigm shift.
From a broader viewpoint, HTML was a simple language for laying out text and images on a webpage, whereas HTML5 can
be viewed as a development platform that does what HTML does that and more, including better support for audio, video,
and interactive graphics. It has a number of new elements, supports offline data storage for applications, and has more robust
exchange protocols.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is a tag?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In HTML, a tag tells the browser what to do. When you write an HTML page, you enter tags for many reasons
-- to change the appearance of text, to show a graphic, or to make a link to another page. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How do I create frames? What is a frameset?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Frames allow an author to divide a browser window into multiple (rectangular) regions. Multiple documents
can be displayed in a single window, each within its own frame. Graphical browsers allow these frames to be
scrolled independently of each other, and links can update the document displayed in one frame without
affecting the others.
<br>
You can't just "add frames" to an existing document. Rather, you must create a frameset document that defines
a particular combination of frames, and then display your content documents inside those frames. The frameset
document should also include alternative non-framed content in a NOFRAMES element.
The HTML 4 frames model has significant design flaws that cause usability problems for web users. Frames
should be used only with great care. </p>

								<h2>CSS Interview Question & Answers</h2>
								<button class="accordion">What are the possible ways to apply CSS styles to a web page?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>CSS can be applied in the following three ways:
  <br>
• Linked: Create a separate .css file and add all the style for the web page there. Make sure the file is linked to the HTML
document(s) using the link tag
<br>
• Embedded: Inside the HTML document, open a style tag and inside that, add all styles just like you’d do on a linked file.
<br>
• Inline: This is done by adding a style attribute inside an HTML element.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">Explain the CSS box model.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>CSS box model is made up of margins, borders, padding, and content. The box model provides a more structured way to space
elements in relationship to each other in web pages. In your browser’s developer tools, the CSS box model is found at the end of
the CSS section and it looks like this:</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion"> What is the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Although these two properties seem similar, there is quite an important difference between the two:
  <br>
• visibility:hidden hides the element, but it will still takes up space, this way affecting the layout of the document.
<br>
• display:none also hides the element, but will not take up space and the page will appear as if the element is not present.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What are CSS preprocessors and why do we use them?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>CSS preprocessors convert code written in a preprocessed language like SASS or LESS into the same old CSS we’ve been using
for such a long time now. The main advantages of using preprocessors are:
<br>
• Ability to define variables
<br>
• Ability to use nested syntax
<br>
• Ability to create and use mixins (functions)
<br>
• Use of mathematical and operational functions
<br>
However, there are also some disadvantages like updating issues and debugging difficulties.</p>
</div> 
								<button class="accordion">What are grid systems and why do we use them in web pages?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Grid systems are structured rules that enable content to be stacked horizontally and vertically in a consistent and sustainable way.
They find heavily usage in today’s websites because they offer increased producitvity while coding, they’re versatile and ideal
for responsive layouts</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion"> What is the purpose of the z-index and how is it used?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element within the document area (or a part of it). An element with greater
stack order will always be in front of an element with a lower stack order. However, z-index only works on positioned elements
(position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed). It can have four kind of values:
<br>
• Auto: Sets the stack order equal to its parents.
<br>
• Number: Orders the stack order.
<br>
• Initial: Sets this property to its default value (0).
<br>
• Inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.</p>

								<h2>HTML5 Interview Question & Answers</h2>
								<button class="accordion">What are some of the major new API’s that come standard with HTML5?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Among others: Media API, Text Track API, Application Cache API, User Interaction, Data Transfer API, Command API, and
the History API.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is the difference in caching between HTML5 and the old version of HTML?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>An crucial new feature of HTML5 is the Application Cache which creates an offline version of a web application. and stores
website files such as HTML files, CSS, images, and JavaScript, locally. Obviously, that speeds up site performance</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is image map?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>An image map is a list of coordinates relating to a specific image, created in order to hyperlink areas of the image to different
destinations (as opposed to a normal image link, in which the entire area of the image links to a single destination).</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is the advantage of collapsing white space?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>White spaces are blank sequences of space characters, which is actually treated as a single space character in HTML. The browser
collapses multiple space into a single space, so we can indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces. This enables
us to organize the code into a much more readable format</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What are data- attributes good for?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>data- attribute is used to assigns custom data to an element. The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page’s JavaScript
to create a more engaging user experience.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">Describe the difference between cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Cookies are small text files that websites place in a browser for tracking or login purposes, and hold a modest amount of data.
Meanwhile, localStorage and sessionStorage are new objects, both of which are storage specifications but vary in scope and
duration. Local storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.
Futhermore, is it permanent. sessionStorage only lasts as long as the duration of the longest open tab.</p>

								<h2>Javascript Interview Question & Answers</h2>
								<button class="accordion">Define event bubbling.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Because JavaScript allows DOM elements to be nested inside each other, if the handler of the child is clicked, the handler of
 parent will also work as if it were clicked too. That sums up what event bubbling really is.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is "this" keyword in Javascript?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>this is used to refer to the current object in the code. In the global execution context (outside of any function), this refers to
the global object, whether in strict mode or not.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">Does Javascript support automatic type conversion?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes. JavaScript does support automatic type conversion and it is the common way of type conversion used by JavaScript developers.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is event delegation and how does it work?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Event delegation allows us to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes of the DOM; instead, the event listener is added to
one parent. Using event delegation it’s possible to add an event handler to an element, wait for an event to bubble up from a child
element and easily determine from which element the event originated.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is the difference between window.onload and onDocumentReady?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The window.onload event will not trigger until every single element on the page has been fully loaded, including CSS, images
and/or other assets. The main disadvantage is that it might take a while before any code is actually executed. On the other hand,
onDocumentReady executes code as soon as DOM is loaded.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">Which is faster between Javascript and ASP?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Javascript is obviously faster. Why? Because Javascript is a client-side language and execution does not need assistance from
the web server. In contrast, ASP is server-side therefore is slower.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is an anonymous function is Javascript</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>An anonymous function is a function declared without any named identifier and in general, is not accessible after its declaration</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">Explain the role of break and continue statements.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>• Break statements are used to come out of the current loop
  <br>
• Continue statements continue the current loop with a new recurrence</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">How are object properties assigned in JS?</button>

  <p>Similar to the way a value is assigned to a variable, we assign object properties like this for example: document.form.
action="submit"</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is the difference between undeclared and undefined variables?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>• Undeclared variables are variables that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of
an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is generated.
<br>
• Undefined variables are variables that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to
read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>Well, jQuery is not a programming language, but a well written JavaScript code (a framework). It is a library built with Javascript.
Javascript is the core programming language. It is very popular because it abstracts away cross-browser compatibility issues and
emphasises unobtrusive and callback-driven Javascript programming.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is $() in jQuery?</button>

</div>
								<button class="accordion">What are jQuery events?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Events are actions performed on specific conditions. When we perform these actions on an HTML page, we can do whatever
we want. We then use event handlers to perform the action. Some important handlers are for example: bind(), unbind(),
blur(), off(), hover(), on(), one(), ready(),trigger() etc...</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is called chaining?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Chaining is used to connect multiple events and functions in a selector. It means specifying multiple functions and/or selectors
to an element.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What is the difference between event.PreventDefault and event.stopPropagation?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In short, preventDefault(): Stops the default action of an element from happening. event.stopPropagation():
Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, thus preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">How can we hide an image on a button click using jQuery?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We can have a click handler and then the hide method applied to the image:
  <br>
$("#button").click(function(){
<br>
$("#image").hide();
<br>
});</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion"> What is AJAX in jQuery?</button>

• HTML
<br>
• JSON Object</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">How can you find out that an AJAX request has been completed?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We can use the ReadyState property to check whether AJAX request has been completed. If the property is equal to 4, the request
has been completed and data is now available.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">Do AJAX requests retain PHP session info, when calling multiple times?</button>

								<h2>Advanced Javascript Interview Question & Answers</h2>
							    <button class="accordion">What Is The Difference Between Undefined And Not Defined In Javascript?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p></pIn JavaScript, if you try to use a variable that doesn't
exist and has not been declared, then JavaScript will
throw an error var name is not defined and script will
stop executing. However, if you use typeof
undeclared_variable, then it will return undefined.
<br>
Before getting further into this, let's first understand
the difference between declaration and definition.
<br>
Let's say var x is a declaration because you have not
defined what value it holds yet, but you have
declared its existence and the need for memory
allocation.
<br>
> var x; // declaring x
> console.log(x); //output: undefined
Here var x = 1 is both a declaration and definition
(also we can say we are doing an initialisation). In
the example above, the declaration and assignment
of value happen inline for variable x. In JavaScript,
every variable or function declaration you bring to
the top of its current scope is called hoisting.
<br>
The assignment happens in order, so when we try to
access a variable that is declared but not defined yet,
we will get the result undefined.
<br>
var x; // Declaration
if(typeof x === 'undefined') // Will return true
If a variable that is neither declared nor defined,
when we try to reference such a variable we'd get the
result not defined.
<br>
> console.log(y); // Output: ReferenceError: y is not
defined>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What Will Be The Output Of The Code Below? var Y = 1; if (function F(){}) { y += Typeof F; } console.log(y);</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The output would be 1undefined. The if condition
statement evaluates using eval, so eval(function
f(){}) returns function f(){} (which is true).
<br>
Therefore, inside the if statement, executing typeof f
returns undefined because the if statement code
<br>
executes at run time, and the statement inside the if
condition is evaluated during run time.
<br>
var k = 1;
<br>
if (1)
<br>
{
<br>
eval(function foo(){});
<br>
k += typeof foo;
<br>
}
<br>
console.log(k);
<br>
The code above will also output 1undefined.
<br>
var k = 1;
<br>
if (1)
<br>
{
<br>
function foo(){};
<br>
k += typeof foo;
<br>
}
console.log(k); // output 1function</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What Is The Drawback Of Creating True Private Methods In Javascript?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>One of the drawbacks of creating true private
methods in JavaScript is that they are very memoryinefficient, as a new copy of the method would be
created for each instance.
<br>
var Employee = function (name, company, salary)
<br>
{
<br>
this.name = name || ""; //Public attribute
<br>
default value is null
<br>
this.company = company || ""; //Public attribute
<br>
default value is null
<br>
this.salary = salary || 5000; //Public attribute
<br>
default value is null
<br>
// Private method
<br>
var increaseSalary = function ()
<br>
{
<br>
this.salary = this.salary + 1000;
<br>
};
<br>
// Public method
<br>
this.dispalyIncreasedSalary = function()
<br>
{
<br>
increaseSlary();
<br>
console.log(this.salary);
<br>
};
<br>
};
<br>
// Create Employee class object
<br>
var emp1 = new Employee("John","Pluto",3000);
<br>
// Create Employee class object
<br>
var emp2 = new Employee("Merry","Pluto",2000);
<br>
// Create Employee class object
<br>
var emp3 = new Employee("Ren","Pluto",2500);
<br>
Here each instance variable emp1, emp2, emp3 has
<br>
its own copy of the increaseSalary private method.
<br>
So, as a recommendation, don’t use private methods
<br>
unless it’s necessary.</p>

								<button class="accordion">What Will Be The Output Of The Following Code? var Output = (function(x) { Delete X; return X;} )(0); console.log(output);</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The output would be 0. The delete operator is used
to delete properties from an object. Here x is not an
object but a local variable. delete operators don't
affect local variables.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What Will Be The Output Of TheFollowing Code? var X = 1; var Output = (function() { Delete X; Return X; } )(); console.log(output);</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The output would be 1. The delete operator is used
to delete the property of an object. Here x is not an
object, but rather it's the global variable of type
number.</p>
</div>
								<button class="accordion">What Will Be The Output Of The Code Below? var X = { Foo : 1}; var Output = (function() { delete X.foo; return X.foo; } )(); console.log(output);</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The output would be undefined. The delete operator
is used to delete the property of an object. Here, x is
an object which has the property foo, and as it is a
self-invoking function, we will delete the foo
property from object x. After doing so, when we try
to reference a deleted property foo, the result
isundefined.
